==vanilla batch conversion example==

In this example I have configured the tool to do a plain vanilla batch conversion.  

There are four configuration files that are used to initialize the environment via Spring, and the user file.  They are:

|| File || Purpose||
||[imap2exchange-config.xml]||This file creates the object factories and their relationships.||
||[imap2exchange-yale-config.xml]||This file creates yale specific implementations.  You may choose to use these.||
||[imapservers.xml]||This is where the imapservers are configured to their ImapServerFactory||
||[imap2exchange-config.properties]|| This file is the property file that sets the values of all the factories and object defined in the the above spring configuration files.||
||[batchUsers]|| This is the file that the batch loader uses.||
