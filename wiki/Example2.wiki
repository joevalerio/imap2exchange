==batch conversion with mailbox size checker==

In this example I have configured the tool to do a plain vanilla batch conversion, plus I user Yale's ImapMailboxSizer.  If you want to use a mailbox sizer, you will have to implement one.  We have two different source email systems, one system has a web site that I modified to create a quick WS type page to get me the size of a users mailbox.  The other system, I rely on a flat file rsync'ed to my config directory with uids and their mailbox sizes. 

|| *File* || *Change* ||
||[e2_imap2exchange_config_xml imap2exchange-config.xml] || Here you can see that I define the preConversionAction and inject it in the ExchangeConversionFactory||
||[e2_imap2exchange_yale_config_xml imap2exchange-yale-config.xml]|| Here you can see that I instantiate the two ImapMailboxSizers and alias the preConversionAction for sanity's sake in the properties file ||
||[e2_imapservers_xml imapservers.xml] || In this file you can see where I injected the previously defined ImapMailboxSizers into the ImapServers for the preConversionAction to use. ||
||[e2_imap2exchange_config_properties imap2exchange-config.properties]|| In here you can see that I define the values of the properties for the fore mentioned objects. ||
