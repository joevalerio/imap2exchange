==batch conversion with mailbox size checker==

In this example I have configured the tool to do a plain vanilla batch conversion, plus I user Yale's ImapMailboxSizer.  If you want to use a mailbox sizer, you will have to implement one.  We have two different source email systems, one system has a web site that I modified to create a quick WS type page to get me the size of a users mailbox.  The other system, I rely on a flat file rsync'ed to my config directory with uids and their mailbox sizes.  I will eventually write a generic IMAP sizer, but it will be slow, especially for UW servers.  So in the short term you will have to implement your own.

|| File || Change ||
||[imap2exchange-config.xml|imap2exchange-config.xml - mailbox size checker] || Here you can see that I define the preConversionAction and inject it in the ExchangeConversionFactory||
||[imap2exchange-yale-config.xml|imap2exchange-yale-config.xml - mailbox size checker]|| Here you can see that I instantiate the two ImapMailboxSizers and alias the preConversionAction for sanity's sake in the properties file ||
||[imapservers.xml|imapservers.xml - mailbox size checker] || In this file you can see where I injected the previously defined ImapMailboxSizers into the ImapServers for the preConversionAction to use. ||
||[imap2exchange-config.properties|imap2exchange-config.properties - mailbox size checker]|| In here you can see that I define the values of the properties for the fore mentioned objects. ||
